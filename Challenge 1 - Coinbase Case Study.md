## Overview and Origin

   Coinbase is a platform for accessing the cryptoeconomy. According to the company's website, its mission is "to increase economic freedom in the world." The original idea for Coinbase was to make it possible for anyone, anywhere to easily and securely send and receive Bitcoin. Although Bitcoin still has the highest trading volume to this day, there are now more than 100 tradable cryptocurrencies available on the platform.
   
   The company was founded by Brian Armstrong in the United States in June 2012, with Fred Ehrsam joining him later that year as the company's co-founder. In order to obtain startup funds for the company Brian Armstrong enrolled in the "Y Combinator startup incubator program," and he recieved $150,000. Using those startup funds Coinbase was able to begin its services on October 8, 2012; since then it has raised a total funding of 547 million dollars from various investors over 13 rounds of funding.

## Business Activities

   Cryptocurrency is relatively new to the world. Although the concept of cryptocurrency is becoming more and more well-known it is not yet seen as a traditional asset class, and therefore large financial institutions have not made trading or custody of cryptocurrency available to their clients. As was mentioned above, Coinbase **does** provide access to the cryptoeconomy and seeks to make it easy and secure to trade, transfer, and store cryptocurrency.
   
   One of Coinbase's main goals is to provide education about the world of cryptocurrency because it is such a new domain within the financial industry. The blockchain firm TripleA recently reported: "As of 2023, we estimated global crypto ownership rates at an average of 4.2%, with over 420 million crypto users worldwide." This means that approximately 95.8% of the world does not own any cryptocurrency. In order for Coinbase to continue to grow they need crypto adoption and demand to increase; for this reason they put a great emphasis on education and advertising.
   
   An increase in crypto adoption and demand would not benefit Coinbase, however, if the customers do not choose to utilize Coinbase's platform. Thus the company also focuses heavily on compliance, and strives to be the most trusted crypto platform in the world. Their competitive advantage in the industry comes from their name recognition and a general consensus of trust among the crypto community. Being part of a digital industry that is succeptible to hackers and breaches, security is a matter of the utmost importance for most customers. Unlike many of its industry competitors, Coinbase has never been hacked; Coinbase provides the security users expect when it comes to handling and investing their money. One example of a security measure Coinbase takes is storing up to 97% of bitcoin in encrypted, geographically separated, offline storages, while insuring all bitcoin they store in online computers.

## Landscape

   Within the financial industry there are many domains. Coinbase could fall under several of those domains, but Coinbase refers to itself as a crypto company. They utilize a blend of technology and finance to drive innovation and economic growth in the world. The crypto domain was nonexistent until Bitcoin was created in 2009. Since then technologists and developers have advanced this domain with innovations such as other cryptocurrencies, tokenization, and the blockchain. Today, according to CoinMarketCap, the global market cap for cryptocurrency is $1.07 trillion. Some of the other major companies/competitors that have helped grow this crypto domain include:
   * Binance
   * Kraken
   * Robinhood
   * Crypto.com
   * BitMart
   * Gemini
   
   As was previously mentioned, global adoption of cryptocurrency is still extremely low, which suggests there is potential for Coinbase and these other companies to grow exponentially in the coming years.

## Results

   For a company that is less than a decade old Coinase has already made a powerful impact in the world. It was one of the first platforms to allow retail traders and institutions to buy, sell, transfer and store cryptocurrency, which has begun a movement to create a new, open financial system. Coinbase made history in April 2021 being the first crypto company to go public, subsequently opening up a door for the company to raise additional capital to help grow the company and the cryptoeconomy as a whole.

Coinbase seems to have solidified itself as one of the top crypto platforms in the world. A couple of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success are number of users on the platform and trading volume on the platform. According to CoinStats, "Coinbase is the most popular crypto exchange in the US, with over 50 million users." Coinbase is also a top five crypto exchange based on their market share of trading volume; GoinGecko currently has Coinbase at #4 in regards to trading volume with a 6.5% market share. The future is unknown for crypto and Coinbase, but thus far this domain and this company have had a strong effect on the world of finance.

## Recommendations

   Overall Coinbase seems to be doing well at growing the company while avoiding security breaches and bankrupcty like so many other exchanges in this domain have succumb to. Even though Coinbase is doing well as is, I have a couple recommendations that I feel could benefit this company greatly.

   My first recommendation would be to offer margin trading on the platform. One of Coinbase's competitors, Robinhood, offers this service to its customers. It gives their customers the ability to leverage their holdings and obtain additional buying power as needed. According to Robinhood's website, they charge "a standard margin interest rate of 12% and a margin interest rate of 8% for customers who subscribe to Gold." This interest revenue would provide an additional source of revenue for Coinbase while making an additional service available to its customers. They could also do a discounted margin rate for their Coinbase One subscribers similar to what Robinhood does for their "Gold" subscribers.
   
   The second recommendation I have for Coinbase is to provide loans using customers' cryptocurrency as collateral; a form of securities-based lending (SBL). These types of loans are very common in the financial industry; they allow customers to have access to capital without having to sell their securities. SBL is not only beneficial to the customers, but similar to margin trading it would provide another source of interest revenue for Coinbase. Coinbase used to offer this service through a program called Coinbase Borrow, but it was discontinued rather quickly due to lack of demand. I believe that as the global adoption of crypto increases Coinbase should bring back this service as it would benefit the customers and the company immensely.
